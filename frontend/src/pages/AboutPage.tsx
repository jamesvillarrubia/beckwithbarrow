            About Our Studio
          </h1>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-sans text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Founded by a passionate team of designers and architects, Beckwith Barrow emerged from a 
            shared vision to create spaces that seamlessly blend form and function. Our founders bring 
            together decades of combined experience in residential and commercial design, each contributing 
            their unique perspective and expertise to every project.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-sans text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            What sets our team apart is our collaborative approach and commitment to understanding each 
            client's individual story. We believe that great design begins with great listening, and our 
            process is built around creating deep partnerships with those we serve. From initial concept 
            to final installation, we work closely with our clients to ensure every detail reflects their 
            vision and enhances their daily experience.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-sans text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Our team's diverse backgrounds in architecture, interior design, and project management allow 
            us to approach each project holistically, considering not just how a space looks, but how it 
            feels, functions, and evolves with the people who inhabit it. This comprehensive approach has 
            earned us recognition in the industry and, more importantly, the trust and satisfaction of our clients.
